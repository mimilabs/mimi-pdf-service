Dear Madam/Sir:

This letter is to request approval for the surgery, hospital, and post-surgical care associated with $procedurename for $patientname.  
This patient is scheduled for surgery on $surgerydate.

The $procedurename is clinically appropriate for my patient as $reasonsforappropriateness.  
In addition, your health planâ€™s coverage policy states that the $procedurename is considered medically necessary for patients with $riskfactors.

Please fax your approval to my office at the following number $faxnumber or contact me with additional questions.
